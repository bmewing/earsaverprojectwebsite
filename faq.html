			<h1>How much are you charging for these ear savers?</h1>
			<p>We <strong>are not selling</strong> these ear savers. We are <strong>donating</strong> them to the heroes working on the front-line of our healthcare.</p>
			<h1>Did you invent ear savers?</h1>
			<p>We did <strong>not</strong> invent ear savers - in fact, we're not even the first group giving them away. We are simply a group of interested volunteers with the tools and the means to manufacture and distribute them.</p>
			<h1>Do I have to be in the Volunteer State to receive ear savers?</h1>
			<p>You do <strong>not</strong> need to be located in Tennessee to request and receive ear savers. However, we may prioritize local deliveries (based on where our volunteer printers are located) simply to manage costs.</p>
			<h1>What will you do with my information if I request ear savers?</h1>
			<p>Your information will be deleted as soon as we have finished coordinating delivery with you - it will not be sold or used for any other purpose.</p>
			<h1>Can I help?</h1>
			<p>If you have a 3D printer and would like to help, please reach out to us via the contact page above.</p>
			<p>We are <strong>not</strong> a registered charity so we are not able to accept donations.</p>
